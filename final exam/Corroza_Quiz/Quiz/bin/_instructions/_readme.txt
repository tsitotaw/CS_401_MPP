Problems for this quiz are in packages pipeline, innerclass, and lambdalib.
The classes you will query, like Employee and Address, are all contained
in the quizclasses package. Test data is created in the two "test data"
classes in that package -- to get test data, call either getList (on EmployeeTestData)
or getTransactions (on TraderTransactTestData).

1. Start with the pipeline package. There are 3 problems in the form
of methods prob1(), prob2(), prob3(). Each needs to be solved with
a stream pipeline; instructions for each are in the comments for each.
At the top of the main method you will see a solved sample problem.
When you run the main method, it will run the sample and then
execute prob1(), prob2(), prob3().

2. Next, work on the innerclass package. Here, you will modify
the pipelines you worked out in the pipeline package by 
replacing lambdas with inner classes. A sample is given at the
top of the main method in the Main class.

3. Last, refactor your solutions in the pipeline package so that
most of each solution is encapsulated in a lambda library expression.
A sample is given at the top of the main method in the Main class.
All your lambda library expression should be placed in the class LambdaLibrary,
as in the example.
