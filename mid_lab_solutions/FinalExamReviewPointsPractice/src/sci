principles of SCI.

The stream API is an abstraction of collections that supports aggregate operations like filter and map. 
These operations make it possible to process collections in a declarative style that supports parallelization, 
compact and readable code, and processing without side effects.

Deeper laws of nature are ultimately responsible for how things appear in the world. Efforts to modify the 
world from the surface level only lead to struggle and partial success. Affecting the world by accessing 
the deep underlying laws that structure everything can produce enormous impact with little effort. The key 
to accessing and winning support from deeper laws is going beyond the surface of awareness to the depths within.

itself.

Transcendental Consciousness: TC, which can be experienced in the stillness of
one’s awareness through transcending, is where the laws of nature begin to operate
– it is the home of all the laws of nature
4. Impulses Within the Transcendental Field: As TC becomes more familiar, more
and more, intentions and desires reach fulfillment effortlessly, because of the
hidden support of the laws of nature.
5. Wholeness moving within Itself: In Unity Consciousness, one finally recognizes
the universe in oneself – that all of life is simply the impulse of one’s own
consciousness. In that state, one effortlessly commands the laws of nature for all
good in the universe.
