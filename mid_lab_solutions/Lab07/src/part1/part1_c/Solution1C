A HashMap is used to track duplicates,
but hashCode has not been overridden in
Employee.

The List.contains(...) method is defined to use equals(Object) to decide if the argument object is "contained" by the list. 
So, for complex objects, like Employee, in our case, we need to override equals ... 
assuming that the default implementation is not what you need.
